# BurningRubber

This is the original source code for the mac shareware game "Burning Rubber", originally released in 1995.

The source code is in Pascal, Race.Ï€ is a CodeWarrior project file which was used to build it. To be able to upload this to git, Line endings have been converted to Unix style, and the resource forks of the rsrc files have been moved to the data fork. You may need to revert these changes before being able to build it on a classic Macintosh.
